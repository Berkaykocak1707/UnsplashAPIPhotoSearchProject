# Unsplash API Photo Search Project

This project provides photo search functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Unsplash API. Unsplash is a popular platform that offers a wide range of high-quality free photos. In this project, we utilize the Unsplash API to allow users to search for photos using specific keywords.

## How It Works

1. Download or copy the project files to your computer.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter your desired keyword in the search bar and press Enter.
4. The JavaScript code makes a GET request to the Unsplash API and displays the search results on the page.
